## Hello!
My name is Jonah Pears and I am a PhD student at the University of Kent, UK.
I am reaching the end of my PhD and am curently aiming to submit my thesis by September 2024 (fyi: time of writing 9th July 2024).

I plan to use this blog to host articles that accompany other work.
The writing here will likely be less formal than usual, and will try to assume as little as possible about the reader.
