# TOASTER
> **T**ime**o**ut **A**synchronous **S**ession **T**ypes for **Er**lang

This is a blog post to accompany the [tool](https://github.com/jonahpears/Erlang-on-TOAST-timeout-protocol-reengineering-implementation-) presented in the paper [Erlang on TOAST] at the Erlang Workshop 2024.

## Overview
The tool presented in the paper is the first development of a toolchain for generating *correct-by-construction* Erlang programs from TOAST, which are behavioural types.
Behavioural types are a kind of formal model for describing the interaction structure of a concurrent system while providing guarantees of their behavioural properties.
In the case of session types, the properties we are typically interesting in providing are commuication safety, deadlock freedom and ultimately, progress -- where by progress we mean that the system is guaranteed to either terminate successfully, or continue to make progress indefinitely.
